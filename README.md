# spine-code

This repository contains the P4 code described. We relied heavily on the tutorials found here: https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials. To run the files, you would need to download the VM included with the tutorials and place the solution folder from this project into the tutorials/exercises directory, replace the utils file in the ---- directory with ----- and run "make run".
